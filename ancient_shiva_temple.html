        <p class="blog-content">Hello everyone, today I am going to tell you about an amazing ancient Shiva temple I have visited during my college days. The ancient Ambareshwar Shiva Temple has located at a distance of 2 km from Ambernath railway station in Thane district near Mumbai, Maharashtra. The locals call this temple the ancient Shiva temple. This temple is the oldest of the Bhumij genre and is an excellent example among the Hemadpanthi temples in Maharashtra.  As mentioned in the inscription inside the temple area, the reconstruction of this temple has happened in 1060 A.D. The entire temple has built of black stone by Chittaraj Raja of the Shilahar dynasty. Later his son Mahamandleshwar Mamvaniraja rebuilt the temple in 1060 A.D. It is one of 218 cultural heritages in the world, declared by UNESCO. Out of those 218, India has 25 and Maharashtra has 4.  </p>

        <p class="blog-content">Although the wall around this temple and the Nandimandap in front of it have been destroyed with time, the original temple is still intact. The present temple is in two parts, Assembly Hall and Sanctum area (Garbha Griha). The hall is closed by all sides. In the center of the sabha mandap, there is a domed roof based on four pillars. Four of the original eighteen pillars are visible. The beauty of the roof is enhanced by the sculpture on the roof like the waves created when a stone is thrown into the water. On the pillars of the mandapa, there are many carved idols of Lord Shankar and Parvati in various postures. The sanctum sanctorum is built a little deeper than the Assembly Hall (sabha mandapa). You have to go down 20 steps to reach the Sanctum sanctorum. In the center of the sanctum, a swayambhu Shivling is situated. . The outer walls are carved very beautifully and gracefully on black rock.

          This Shiva temple falls under the Saptang Bhumij pattern. That means the number of corners of the base of this temple is seven. Such seven sculptural queues were formed one on top of the other. However, due to the destruction of the pinnacle over time, only three sculptural queues are remaining. The temple has three entrances. Among them, the main entrance is facing west. A beautiful large stone idol of Nandi can be seen at the entrance. The exterior of the temple is carved with sculptures of beautiful gods and goddesses. It mainly includes the idols of Ganpati, Shankar-Parvati, Lakshmi, Vishnu, Shivparvati marriage ceremony, Goddess Mahakali. Many elephant sculptures are carved on the walls of the temple which feels like the entire temple stands on the back of these elephants. This ancient temple of Lord Shiva is an excellent example of architecture in ancient Indian culture.
